		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<p> My name is Nathan Kuan, and I grew up in San Jose while my dad grew up in Taiwan and my mom in Hong Kong.<br> 
		My favorite and only hobbies are playing tennis and video games. I've played tennis for about 6 years, and I've won many<br>
		first place trophies. Even though I love video games, I can only play on the weekends. The only exceptions are celebrations<br>
		and holidays.</p>
		<p> My favorite food is steak and I have one brother. He goes to the same school, Valley Christian, and he's on the high school<br>
		tennis team. I hope to be on the varsity team for tennis as well when I get to high school. Our whole family speaks Chinese even<br>
		though I hate it.</p>
